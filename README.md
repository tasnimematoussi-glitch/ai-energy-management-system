# Neuro-Fuzzy Smart Home Energy Management System

## Summary
This project implements an intelligent smart home energy management system using LSTM neural networks for energy consumption and solar power prediction, combined with a fuzzy logic controller for adaptive decision-making. A Streamlit dashboard is used to visualize predictions and control decisions.

## Project Status
This project is currently under active development and is not the final version.
