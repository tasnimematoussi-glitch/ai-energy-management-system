# Neuro-Fuzzy Smart Home Energy Management System ⚡

> 🚧 **Project Status: Work in Progress**  
> This project is currently under active development and continuous improvement.  
> This repository does not represent the final version of the system.

## Summary

This project implements an intelligent smart home energy management system that combines
LSTM neural networks for energy consumption and solar power prediction with a fuzzy logic
controller for adaptive and explainable decision-making. An interactive Streamlit dashboard
is used to visualize predictions and system decisions in real time.
